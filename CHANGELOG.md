Critical fix for bot getting stuck on accounts without premium colors.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed bot getting stuck on accounts without premium colors and insufficient droplets to buy them

- Prevents infinite loop when all accounts have charges but none can paint premium pixels

### Technical Changes:

- Server-side automatic field truncation for name and discord fields
- Replaced all bitwise OR operations (| 0) on extraColorsBitmap with string fallback (|| "0")
- Prevents 32-bit truncation that caused loss of premium color data for colors 64-95

## Changelog v4.3.7
Bug fixes and performance improvements for color handling and Cloudflare challenge detection.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed hasColor() method to properly support premium colors 64-95 using BigInt operations
- Premium colors in the upper range (64-95) now correctly detected for ownership checks
- Prevents bot from attempting to paint pixels with colors the account doesn't own

### Performance Improvements:
- Added caching for "No Cloudflare challenge detected" state (1 hour TTL)
- Significantly reduced Python scraper invocations when no CF challenge is present
- First request now gets cached result if no challenge exists, avoiding redundant scraper calls
- Python scraper only runs when actual Cloudflare block is detected (403/502/503)

### Technical Changes:
- Updated CF-Clearance manager to cache negative challenge detection results
- Modified MockImpit.fetch() to handle cached "no challenge" state properly

- Added automatic credential-based account registration system with Turnstile captcha solving
- Created batch registration API with proxy rotation support

### Improvements:
- Cookies are now included in loadTiles requests to prevent Cloudflare blocks during pixel checking
- Added automatic fallback: works without CF-Clearance if no challenge is detected, obtains token on first block
- Improved proxy URL building in registration system
- Enhanced error handling for rate limiting (429 errors) in registration
- Added detailed logging for CF-Clearance operations and debugging

### Technical Changes:
- Proxy selection now integrated into WPlacer login flow
- All POST requests (paint, buyColor, equipFlag) now use centralized browser.fetch with CF support
- CF-Clearance tokens automatically refresh when expired or blocked
- Added registration guide documentation (REGISTRATION_GUIDE.md)
- Created autoreg Python toolkit for batch account creation

### Known Issues:
- System requires extensive testing due to multiple new integrations
- Rate limiting may occur during batch registration operations
- CF-Clearance-Scraper dependency needs proper setup

**IMPORTANT**: This build contains significant changes to core networking. Test thoroughly before production use.

## Changelog v4.2.6-4.2.7
- Added an "Active/Expired accounts" table shown after the status check (you can remove non‚Äëworking accounts with one click).

- Works on Chrome-based browsers (not tested on others). Re-upload the extension to your browser!
Known issues: If you constantly see `‚ùå Background resync finished (error)` on an account while template is running, you should re‚Äëlogin (refresh cookies). HTTP 401 can appear occasionally and usually does not break the flow, but I cannot fully fix it yet. Please remember this build is unstable.
Recommendation: keep a `bplace.org` tab focused (active) while running to avoid throttling and ensure stable token acquisition.

- You need to reload the extension in your browser (refresh it in chrome://extensions or reinstall it).


## Changelog v4.2.2

  - Added a counter to the palette header: ‚ÄúRemaining colors‚Äù now shows the total number of remaining pixels.
  - Added a ‚ÄúRefresh canvas‚Äù button in the preview. Clicking it reloads the visible area.
  - Added an overlay pixel scale slider (50‚Äì100%).
  - When ‚ÄúStop‚Äù is pressed, the template now stops right after the current request to a single tile (fixed).
  - Heatmap: fixed and optimized (You can also now enable and configure this in the template settings).
  - Fixed preserving user checkboxes when opening a template and when changing the user sort order.
  - Added a progress counter to ‚ÄúCheck Account Status‚Äù.
  
Note: The next update will focus on fixing drawing modes, improving template rendering with premium colors, and addressing other core issues. As this is a fork, occasional instability is expected.
